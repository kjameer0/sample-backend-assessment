//Write a POST route that takes user provided data from the request body and creates a new anime in the database. The route should respond with a 200 status code and the new anime.
//if the request body does not contain a name and description, or if the body's name or description have no length, respond with an error

//Write a PUT route that takes user provided data from the request body and updates an existing anime in the database. The route should respond with a 200 and the updated anime. The route should be able to handle a non-existent anime id.
//if the request body does not contain a name and description, or if the body's name or description have no length, respond with an error
